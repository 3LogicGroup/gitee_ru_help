## Create an Issue in the repository

Click on your repository and click the 'issue' button on the top of the repository homepage to enter the issue page. Here you can see all the existing 'issues' of the repository along with their corresponding 'status', 'assignee', and 'issue number'.
Click the `New Issue` button in the upper right corner of the page to create a new issue.

Add a new Issue's `title` and `task content`. Click the corresponding edit icon in the sidebar to add `assignees`, `labels`, `milestones`, `branches`, `start date - due date`, `pin options`, and `priority` for the Issue. After editing, click `Create`, and a new Issue will be created!
