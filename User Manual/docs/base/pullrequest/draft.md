Gitee now supports submitting PR drafts. When project members have not completed development, you can choose 'Create Pull Request Draft' when submitting a PR.

At the same time, using the PR draft feature can also help other members to review your Fork for feedback. PR submitted as a draft will be prompted on various relevant pages of the PR, and the PR cannot be merged. When ready for code review, you can cancel the draft status of the PR and proceed with normal code review and merging.
