## Can invoices be issued?

You can apply for an invoice, such as a VAT general invoice (electronic invoice is limited to general invoices) or a VAT special invoice. The application steps are as follows:

When cloning the SSH URL, you must be the owner of this repository.

> Note: Generally, general taxpayers can apply for special VAT invoices, and small-scale taxpayers can only apply for ordinary VAT invoices.

## Why was the application for a dedicated invoice rejected?

The application for invoice has been rejected, and you will be prompted with information. You can click on 'Order & Invoice Management' in the Enterprise Management Console, go to 'Order Records', and click on 'Details' to view the rejection reason.

 **Generally, the following situations will be rejected:**

1. There are obvious errors in filling in the invoice information or mailing information
2. The uploaded business license does not match the information provided
3. The uploaded general taxpayer certification materials do not have a general taxpayer seal

 **If situation 3 occurs, please re-upload any of the following types of scanning documents:**

- General taxpayer notification issued by the tax bureau (stamped with the tax seal)
- Value-added tax general taxpayer qualification registration form (stamped with tax seal)
- Attach a scanned copy of the VAT taxpayer registration certificate or business license
- Search for the general taxpayer information of your company on the website of the local tax bureau and upload a screenshot.

> Note: "Three Certificates in One" refers to the business license, organization code certificate, and tax registration certificate in the process of combining three certificates into one. Among them, the tax registration certificate is possessed by both small-scale taxpayers and general taxpayers, so it is impossible to determine whether your company has the qualification of a general taxpayer through the combination of three certificates. Please upload any of the above scan documents.

## Is the data stored in the code repository safe?

Gitee Enterprise provides users with flexible and comprehensive security protection strategies, escorting enterprise data and information security! Currently, we have taken the following measures:

- The entire site is SSL encrypted. Gitee uses encryption and decryption technology to transmit data in encrypted form based on the SSL/TLS protocol, ensuring end-to-end network transmission security throughout the entire data security lifecycle.
- Automatic deletion of enterprise data when an employee leaves. Establish a data firewall for enterprise data and automatically delete all Forked enterprise repository data when an employee leaves, ensuring no leakage of important information.
- Fine-grained permission control. Non-members of the enterprise repository cannot access and obtain resources in the repository.
Automatic repository backup. Snapshots are taken for enterprise repositories and organization repositories under the enterprise, providing code security against accidental deletion.
- Operation log recording. All actions of enterprise members are automatically recorded, enabling issue tracing and accountability.
- More security protection: abnormal behavior monitoring and alerting, two-factor verification for sensitive operations, advanced cloud security protection, 24/7 operation and maintenance monitoring.
