> Milestones are a project planning tool used to centrally manage the progress of issues and pull requests.

During project planning, we can design small milestones for different tasks, marking the desired completion deadline for each task. Try to complete all tasks at each time milestone.

## How to add milestones and manage milestones in Pull Requests?

In the Pull Request page and Issue page of the repository, we can easily find the 'Milestones' button in the upper right corner. Clicking on it will take you to the repository's milestone management page.

On the new milestone page, you can add `Title`, `Due Date`, and `Description` for your newly created milestone.

After the milestone is created successfully, you can associate the PRs that you create or manage in this repository with the milestone.
