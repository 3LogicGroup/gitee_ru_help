The Pull Request Reviewed feature can save the progress of reviewing Pull Request changes for users, effectively distinguishing between viewed and unviewed code.

## How to use

You can find the "Reviewed" feature entry by viewing the "Files" list of changes on a PR detail page.

By checking "Read", you can mark the viewing status of the corresponding file. When a file is selected as "Read", the corresponding changed file will be automatically collapsed, and the number of "Read" files will be displayed on the page.

> When there are code changes in the Pull Request, the system will automatically cancel the "Reviewed" status for the corresponding changed files.
