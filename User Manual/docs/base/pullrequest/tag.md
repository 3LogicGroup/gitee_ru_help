## How to add tags and manage tags for Pull Requests?

Pull Request creators and target repository managers can add labels to Pull Requests.

1. The creator of the Pull Request can add existing labels to the PR by clicking the edit icon next to the label feature on the right side of the new PR page.

2. The manager of the target repository of the Pull Request can find the tag function on the right side of the PR details page, click the edit icon next to it, and select the existing tags of the repository to add to the PR.

According to the prompt in the above figure, the repository manager can click the 'Tag Management' button in the drop-down bar of the label to enter the tag management page and deploy all the tags of the repository. Alternatively, you can find and click the 'Tag Management' button on the repository's Pull Request page.

Repository managers can 'edit' and 'delete' existing tags, as well as perform 'create tags' and 'import tags' operations, where importing tags allows the manager to import tags from other repositories they manage into the current repository.
