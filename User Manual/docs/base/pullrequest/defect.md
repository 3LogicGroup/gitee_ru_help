> Gitee officially provides a brand new code quality analysis tool - Gitee Scan, which scans the repository code from the aspects of code defects and code specifications, checks for vulnerabilities, and escorts the code quality improvement.

Note: Paid enterprise users have code defect scanning enabled by default, which will automatically scan for defects and specification issues in any submitted pull requests.

1. First, make sure that the switch for incremental scanning is turned on in [Gitee Scan]:

2. When the reviewer performs code review/testing on the Pull Request, they can view the defect/specification report content in the 'Defect Report' and 'Specification Report' below each Pull Request.
