Introduction

`Gitee Lightweight PR` (Gitee Pull Request Lite) is a feature that allows you to quickly create and submit a merge request (`Pull Request`) to a specific repository without forking the repository.

In the open-source world, most developers are not developers (Developer) or maintainers (Maintainer) of the open-source project repositories. Therefore, most developers need to follow these steps to contribute to an open-source project:

1. Developer Forks the main repository to their account as a forked repository
2. Contribute code in the replica repository (add, delete, modify code, etc.)
3. Submit the modified content of the copy to the main repository as a Pull Request
4. The author reviews the code you submit and decides whether to merge it

During the process, users need to fork a copy of the open-source project repository, occupying repository space under their own account. Forking and cloning involve network transmission and waiting time, which brings certain time and operational costs to creating a Pull Request.

> With 'Lightweight PR', developers only need to complete code contributions (add, delete, modify code, etc.) on the web, and they can easily submit a Pull Request to the open-source project repository with just one click, eliminating many tedious operations in between.

# Usage Instructions
