## What is Pull Request?

> Pull Request is translated as a pull request, which is a way for two repositories to submit changes. It is usually used to submit differences between forked repositories and the original repository. It is also a very good collaborative way to contribute to team projects or open source projects. After you pull and modify someone else's code, you notify the original author of your changes and request them to merge your modifications, which is called a Pull Request.

The use of the word 'pull' here is very vivid~ It's like there's a rope connecting the code in the original repository and the code you forked. You fetched someone else's code and made some fixes and improvements, hoping that the other party will accept it. So you request the original author: I've made changes to your code, please pull it back and take a look!

## What process does a Pull Request go through?

When you want to modify code in someone else's repository, follow the steps below:

1. First fork someone else's repository, create a copy of the repository that is the same as the original repository, after all, the original author will not let you directly modify his code!
2. Clone the branch you want to modify to a local branch and make the necessary changes.
3. Initiate a Pull Request to the original repository so that the original author can see the changes you made and review them. If they approve your changes, they will merge your branch into their project.

The entire process of the pull request is now complete~
