"Private repositories" are tools provided by Gitee for small technical team collaboration, with a maximum of 5 members participating in private repositories.

To avoid affecting your normal use, please make sure to reduce the number of members in your personal private repository to comply with the rules (<=5 people) before **December 31, 2018**. **If you do not upgrade to an enterprise or reduce the number of members in your private repository, all private repositories will become read-only.** The detailed operation instructions are as follows:

## 1. How to determine if the number of collaborators in a personal private repository exceeds 5?

Go to personal "Settings" - "Private Repository Members" to see which members are currently in the private repository.

## Second, how to handle if the number of members in the personal private repository exceeds 5?

### 2.1 Purchase Gitee Enterprise Edition

**To retain more than 5 private repository members, please use [Gitee Enterprise](https://gitee.ru/enterprises/?from=personal-collaborators) and purchase the corresponding package to get the quota.**

 _Note: If the current number of collaborators in the personal private repository exceeds the limit, you can directly upgrade to the enterprise version, but because it exceeds the limit, it will still enter a locked state and you must pay to continue using it!_
