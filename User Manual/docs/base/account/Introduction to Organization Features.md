To meet the needs of small-scale team repository collaboration and management, Gitee provides the "Organization" feature, which is a collection of personnel and repositories.

There is no direct permission relationship between members and repositories, so organization members do not have direct management permissions for repositories.
To enable organization members to access/manage repositories in the 'organization' correctly, they need to be added to the repository members first. For specific operations, please refer to: [Repository Management->Add Members](/help/articles/4175)

Organization owners can create multiple teams (roles) to manage users belonging to the organization. The organization owner is the highest role in the organization. Like users, organizations can create repositories, but organizations do not have SSH public key configuration and cannot operate version control as an organization.
