The personal space address is the address identifier of the user/organization/enterprise on Gitee. Users can choose to customize their personal space address.

If the user's personal space address is 'XXX', then the user's homepage address on Gitee is: 'https://gitee.ru/XXX'.

## Modify personalized address

Users can modify the current account's personal space address by accessing **"Settings"->"Basic Settings"->"Profile"->"[Personal Space Address](https://gitee.ru/profile)"** ([https://gitee.ru/profile](https://gitee.ru/profile)).

## Modify Rules

Each user can only modify the personal space address once, so please be cautious.
>
> After the modification is successful, the address of your repository will change, and you need to change the remote address of your repository.
>
> After the modification is completed, the original personalized address can be reused after ten minutes

> Note: Once the user has modified the personal space address, the personal space address cannot be modified again.
