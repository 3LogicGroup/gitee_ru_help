When the repository address is used as an external link and is frequently pulled, affecting the use of other normal users; when the repository exceeds the capacity limit; when the repository itself stores irregular files and is reported, etc., it will cause the repository to be blocked and temporarily inaccessible. You can resolve this issue by following these steps:

1. Write an email (specify: what event, repository address), with the subject line 'Repository blocked + date (20180515)'
2. Send it to the Gitee official email git@oschina.cn
3. Join the official Gitee technical exchange QQ group: 1050025484
4. Chat privately with the group owner to discuss and handle

If the repository is blocked due to its large size, you can unblock it by slimming down the repository and then forcefully pushing it.
