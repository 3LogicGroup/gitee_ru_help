### Why can't personal accounts unbind phone numbers

It is not possible to unbind the phone number directly if the account has the following situations.

* If there are enterprise accounts under a personal account or if the account is a member of an enterprise account, unbinding the phone is not allowed.
* If the personal account is registered with a mobile phone number and is the only login method, unbinding the phone is not allowed.

### Personal account is already the creator or member of an enterprise account and cannot unbind the mobile number

#### Personal account is a member of the enterprise account

You can first log out of the enterprise account and then unbind it. After unbinding, you can contact the enterprise account administrator/creator to join the enterprise account.

#### Personal account is the creator of the enterprise account

For free enterprise accounts without important data, you can delete or transfer the enterprise before unbinding.

For enterprise accounts that are paid/free and have important data, the original phone number can only be released by changing to another phone number.

Note: Delete operation is not supported for paid enterprises.
