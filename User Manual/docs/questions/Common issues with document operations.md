### 1. Does wiki document editing content get automatically saved in real-time?

When editing wiki documents, switching from normal mode to full-screen and then back to normal window mode will not lose the edited content. This switching process does not have automatic saving. Only when returning to the normal window and clicking save, the system will officially save the file version.

### 2. Will there be a prompt when leaving the wiki document page without saving?

When leaving the wiki document editing page, the browser will automatically prompt if there are unsaved contents and ask if you want to leave.
