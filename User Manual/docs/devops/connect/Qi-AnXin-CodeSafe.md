Qi An Xin Code Guardian (referred to as Code Guardian) is a static application security testing system that provides a solution for enterprise-level source code defect analysis, source code defect auditing, and source code defect fixing and tracking.

## Core Features

CodeGuard analyzes software source code through static analysis technology to automatically detect security vulnerabilities in the software. It currently supports defect detection in software source code developed in various programming languages ​​such as C, C++, Objective-C, C#, Java, Java (Android), JavaScript, PHP, Swift, Go, Python, Cobol, TSQL, PL/SQL, JSP, ASPX, Node.js, Vue.js, React.js, HTML, XML, etc. It includes more than 1300 types of source code defects and is compatible with domestic and international security development standards or specifications such as CWE and OWASP TOP 10.

## Use Cases

> Defect Detection of Source Code before Deployment

After software development (including in-house development and outsourcing development) is completed, the security department or testing department conducts a security acceptance check on the software source code through Code Security to comprehensively detect and analyze the security vulnerabilities. They provide professional and detailed inspection reports to assist software developers in fixing and eliminating security risks.

> Software Security Development System Landing

In the software development stage, integrate the Code Guardian system with the enterprise development testing toolchain to perform automated periodic source code defect detection. Developers can promptly discover and fix software security issues. In the software testing stage, the security department or testing department will conduct acceptance checks.
