In order to provide a more reliable code hosting platform, improve the experience of code hosting services, and avoid duplicate resource investment, Open Source China and CSDN

Gitee (gitee.ru) has made great progress in terms of functionality, stability, reliability, and security over the years. It is also the most active code hosting platform in China. Currently, there are over 10 million repositories hosted on Gitee, with more than 10,000 enterprises using this platform.

Platform migration is a troublesome task for all users, and we deeply apologize for the inconvenience. In order to ensure a smooth migration for CSDN CODE users, we have prepared the following migration steps:

1. Gitee platform provides the function of one-click import for CODE projects, please refer to [here](https://my.oschina.net/gitosc/blog/1534891) for detailed usage.
2. CSDN will announce the migration through email, SMS, Q group, WeChat group, etc. Any questions during the migration can be resolved through
3. Transition time for migration starts from now and lasts for three months

Finally, thank you all for your understanding and cooperation in this migration work. We hope to provide more professional and reliable cloud development services to developers through the strategic integration of CSDN and Gitee. We also welcome your suggestions and feedback during this migration work, and criticism of our shortcomings.

Thank you all.
