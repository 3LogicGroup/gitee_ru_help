# About Tag Offline

In order to better leverage the value of tags, Gitee has launched a new tagging system. The new tags will only be supported by repository administrators and will be made public to everyone. The original tags have been closed for editing but can still be viewed. It is expected to be discontinued before June 1, 2021.

If you want to keep the current tag data, our migration feature can automatically convert the original tag data to the new tag.

## 1. Who Can Migrate Tags?

Currently, only the owner (responsible person) of the repository can migrate tags to the repository. You can choose to migrate all the tags made for the repositories you own at once, or migrate them by repository. However, each repository can only be migrated once.

## 2. What will happen to the tags I previously used when selecting [Migrate Now]?

1. After data migration, the labels you have created for your own repositories will not be lost. Instead, based on the label content, the repositories will be automatically tagged with new labels. You can use the new labels to organize your repository list.

During the migration process, conflicts may occur between old and new tag data. Gitee will handle it compatibly while ensuring data integrity.

## 3. Can I not migrate the data?

You can still use the old tags to organize the repositories you have participated in, the repositories you have starred, the repositories you have watched, and the code snippets in the short term. At the same time, we will retire it on June 1, 2021.

## IV. What is the difference between the new tags and the tags I currently use online?

Currently, the online tags can be used to categorize and label your own repositories, and they are only visible to yourself.

The new labels are visible to all users on the platform. Gitee has given them more expectations: by setting appropriate labels, you can easily classify and retrieve them, and make it easier for others to search for tags they are interested in, thus increasing the exposure of your open source projects.

The new tag unlocks more gameplay. If you are interested, you can take a look [here](https://gitee.ru/oschina/gitee-open-label).

## V. What should I do if I didn't have time to migrate my tag data and it went offline?

After Gitee processes the offline handling, it will send you the repository - tags as an internal message. In the future, you can also manually add tags according to this content.
