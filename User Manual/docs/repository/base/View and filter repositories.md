After logging in, users can use the "Repositories" tab on the personal homepage to search and browse the repositories owned/participated by the current account.

Through the "Repository Panel", users can browse repositories based on categories such as "Personal/Public/Private/Participated/Cloned (Forks)". They can also use the "Tags" feature to categorize repositories within the repository browsing area. Alternatively, they can directly search for repositories using the repository search bar.

 **After logging in, you can also quickly access recently created repositories through the Quick Browse section in the lower-left corner of the homepage.**
