- 2. Fill in the repository information on the new repository page. The concepts related to repositories are explained as follows:
  - **Repository Name**: The name of the repository used for repository naming
  - **Ownership**: The ownership of the repository can be a personal account/organization/enterprise. After creation, the account becomes the default owner (administrator) of the repository.
  - **Path**: The git access path of the repository, composed of `user personal address + repository path name`. After creating the repository, users will access the repository through this path.
- **Repository Introduction**: A brief introduction to the repository
- **Is it open source**: Set whether the repository is a public repository, public repositories are visible to everyone, private repositories are only visible to repository members.
  - **Select Language**: The primary programming language used in the repository
  - **Add `.gitignore`**: A system-provided template for ignoring files in git commits. After setting `.gitignore`, specified directories/files will be ignored by default in the repository.
- **Add an open source license**: If the repository is public, you can add an open source license to set the licensing constraints for the current project repository and derivative project repositories. The open source license determines whether the open source project is business-friendly.
  - **Readme**: Project repository's self-description document, usually containing software descriptions or usage instructions.
- **Initialize repository using `***template files`**: Initialize the repository using `Issue` or `Pull Request` file templates.
- 3. Click on "Create" to create your first repository on [Gitee].
