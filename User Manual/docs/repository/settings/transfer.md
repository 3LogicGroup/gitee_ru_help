Gitee now provides 3 types of transfers: **Transfer repository to individual**, **Transfer repository to organization**, **Transfer repository to enterprise**. Users can go to **'Manage' -> 'Repository Settings' -> 'Transfer Repository'** to perform the transfer operation on a repository.

### 1. Transfer repository to other members

> Need confirmation from the other party through private message, accept the transfer

- After successful transfer, the repository owner becomes the target user, other members' permissions remain the same, and the source repository owner is removed from the repository but defaults to watch public repositories.

### 2. Transfer Repository to Organization

> Repositories can be transferred to organizations that you create or join

- After the transfer is successful, the owner of the repository becomes the owner of the organization, and the permissions of other members remain unchanged

### 3. Transfer repository to enterprise

> Repositories can be transferred to enterprises that you create or join
>
To transfer to another company, you need to generate a transfer code in the target company's Enterprise Edition by going to "Warehouse Management" -> "Create Warehouse/Transfer Warehouse" -> "Generate Transfer Code".

- After the transfer is successful, the owner of the repository becomes the owner of the enterprise, and the permissions of other members remain unchanged
