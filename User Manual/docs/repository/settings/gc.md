As the usage of the repository increases, the size of the project repository grows, which leads to reduced access speed and efficiency. To address this, Git provides the GC function to help optimize the repository space.

Users can optimize the repository space by accessing the repository homepage->"Manage"->"Repository Settings"->"Repository GC" and using the repository GC function.
