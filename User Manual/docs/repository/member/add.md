Users can add members to the repository for collaboration through **Repository homepage->"Manage"->"Repository Settings"->"Repository Members Management"->"Add Repository Member"**.

Currently, there are three ways to add members: **Invite via link**, **Directly add**, **Invite members through repository**

## Invite Members via Link

By selecting the role to join as a member, different invitation links can be generated. These links can be shared with others through QQ/QR code, etc., to invite users to join the repository. At the same time, by checking the 'require administrator approval' option, after the members confirm, the administrators can review again.

## Add members directly

After the user selects a role, search and add the Gitee user's personalized address or email to invite them to join the repository. After the invitation is accepted, the invitee will be added directly to the repository.
If the invited user is not a Gitee user, the system will send an invitation link to the target email, and the link will be valid for 3 days.

Inviting Members through Repositories

Users can search for repositories that the current account has participated in. Invite users from other repositories to join the repository.
