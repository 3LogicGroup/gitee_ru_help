## Set the default branch for the repository

After clicking on the 'Branches' button on the top left of the repository main page, you can see all the existing branches of the repository. The default branch will be marked with an orange icon next to the default branch name. In the right-hand action column of non-default branches, by clicking on the branch icon below, you can change that non-default branch to the default branch.

## Delete Branch

In the repository, only non-default branches can be deleted. To delete a non-default branch, click on the trash can icon in the right-hand action column of the branch.
