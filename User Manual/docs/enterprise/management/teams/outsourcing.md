### What is an Outsourced Team?

In the development process of a repository, due to insufficient internal development members and considering repository costs, some non-core modules are often outsourced to third-party teams for development. However, small and medium-sized teams lack management experience in this regard, and there are few repository management tools that support outsourcing on the market. Gitee addresses this dilemma faced by enterprises by clearly distinguishing internal and outsourced teams based on personnel and repositories, which facilitates later management of teams in repositories and personnel.
