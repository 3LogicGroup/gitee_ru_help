Deploy public keys allow read-only access to repositories, mainly used for deploying repositories on production servers, eliminating the need to enter passwords for each operation using HTTP and the hassle of accidentally modifying repository code using SSH.

Click on the "Settings" - "Deploy Keys" in the Enterprise Navigation menu to enter the Deploy Keys page.
