If the number of enterprise members has exceeded the current package's free quota of 5, the enterprise will enter a read-only state. Please upgrade the package to get more quota (by paying) or reduce the number of members to <= 5 to unlock. The detailed operation help is as follows:

### 1. View enterprise members

To enter the enterprise interface, select "Members" to view the current enterprise members.
