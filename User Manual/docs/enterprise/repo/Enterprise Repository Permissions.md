### What is the difference between internal repositories in enterprise projects and outsourced projects?

When creating a company repository, you can choose the type of repository. If the project is developed by your own team, you can choose an internal repository. If it is developed by a third-party team, you can choose an outsourcing project. Clear repository division helps with project management and team management.

### What are the differences between private repositories, internal open-source repositories, and external open-source repositories in enterprise repositories?

**Private**: Refers to the situation where even enterprise members cannot access the code and any other information of a private repository if they are not members of that repository. For example, if a task is created by a member of the private repository and associated with that private repository, only other members of that private repository can see this task, and non-members of this private repository cannot see it.

**Internal Open Source**: Refers to the code of the repository and other resources (such as PRs, tasks, wiki, attachments, etc.) can be accessed by all internal personnel of the company.

**External Open Source**: It means that anyone can access the code and any other resources of this repository (such as PRs, tasks, wikis, attachments, etc.).

### Are there any differences in the number of repository members for different types of enterprise repositories?

Enterprise private repositories and enterprise internal open source repositories: Repository members (including member roles such as developers) are limited by the number of enterprise members. Depending on the different paid plans, there will be different restrictions. For example, the standard version allows up to 20 people, so the maximum number of enterprise repository members for standard version users is 20 people, and they must all be enterprise members.
