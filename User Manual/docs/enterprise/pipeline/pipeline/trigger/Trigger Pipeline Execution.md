Gitee pipelines support different types of trigger strategies. You can choose the appropriate method to trigger the pipeline based on your usage scenario.

Currently supported trigger strategies include the following:

- Manually triggered, users can click on Run Pipeline in the pipeline to execute it manually.

- [Code submission trigger](/enterprise/pipeline/source/trigger)

- [Trigger Pipeline on Schedule](/enterprise/pipeline/trigger/corn)

You can trigger the information through the pipeline to see how the pipeline is triggered.
