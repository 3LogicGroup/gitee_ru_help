Pipeline source, as the input source of Gitee pipeline, can obtain raw materials from code hosting services or other third-party services and put these raw materials into the workspace.

Pipelines process and manipulate the input materials in the workspace, which could be tasks like compiling, packaging, executing automation, versioning, etc.

Currently supported pipeline source types:

- Source Code

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Configure Code Source](/enterprise/pipeline/source/code)

- Artifact Source

Configure artifact repository source

- Pipeline Source

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Configure pipeline source](/enterprise/pipeline/source/pipeline)
  
Subsequent releases will also introduce other types of pipeline sources, so stay tuned:

- Artifact Repository
- Object Storage Repository
