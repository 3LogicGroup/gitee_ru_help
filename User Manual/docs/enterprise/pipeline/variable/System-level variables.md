System-level variables are built-in parameters in Gitee Go. These parameters are generated with each build record and can be used in any task. They are described in the form of GITEE_xxx, and can be referenced using ${GITEE_xxx}. System parameters are generated by the system and cannot be changed.

**The built-in system variables are as follows:**

| Environment Variable Name  | Description    |
|---------|-------|
| GITEE_COMPANY | Enterprise Edition Path |
| GITEE_PIPELINE_NAME   | Unique identifier for the pipeline |
| GITEE_PIPELINE_DISPLAY_NAME  | Pipeline name  |
| GITEE_PIPELINE_BUILD_NUMBER  | Pipeline build number |

**If a code source workspace is configured for the task, the following built-in environment variables will be available:**

| Environment Variable Name  | Description    |
