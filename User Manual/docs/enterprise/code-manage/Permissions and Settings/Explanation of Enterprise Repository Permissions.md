### What is the difference between internal repositories in enterprise projects and outsourced projects?

When creating a corporate repository, you will choose the type of enterprise repository. If the project is developed by your own team, you can choose an internal repository. If it is developed by a third-party team, you can choose an outsourcing project. Clear repository division helps with project management and team management in the later stage.

### **What are the differences between private repositories, internal open-source repositories, and external open-source repositories in enterprise repositories?**

**Private**: It means that even if you are a member of the organization, you cannot access the code and any other information of private repositories. For example, if a task is created by a member of a private repository and associated with that private repository, only other members of that private repository can see this task, and non-members of this private repository cannot see it.

**Internal Open Source**: It means that all internal personnel of the company can access the code and any other form of resources in this repository (such as PR, tasks, wiki, attachments, etc.).

**External Open Source**: It refers to a repository that can be accessed by anyone, including the code and any other form of resources (such as PRs, tasks, wikis, attachments, etc.) in that repository.

### **What is the difference in the number of repository members based on different types of Enterprise repositories?**

"**Enterprise Private Repositories and Enterprise Internal Open Source Repositories**: Repository members (including member roles such as developers) are limited by the number of enterprise members. Depending on the different payment plans, there will be different restrictions. For example, the maximum number of standard version is 20 people, so the maximum number of enterprise repository members for standard version users is 20 people, and they must all be enterprise members."
