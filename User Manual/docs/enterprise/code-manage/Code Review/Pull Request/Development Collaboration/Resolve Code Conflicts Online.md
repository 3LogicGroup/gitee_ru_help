### **Function Introduction**

When encountering code conflicts during the use of Pull Request, it is often necessary to retrieve the code locally, handle the code conflicts through 'git merge', and then push it back to the repository.

Gitee provides a WebIDE solution to resolve conflicts online without the need for a client operation.

### **Resolve conflicts online through WebIDE**

1. On the PR page with code conflicts, click 'Try to resolve conflicts using WebIDE' to enter the WebIDE.
