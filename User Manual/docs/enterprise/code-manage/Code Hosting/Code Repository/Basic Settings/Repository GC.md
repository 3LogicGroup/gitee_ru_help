As the usage of the repository increases, the size of the project repository becomes larger, and the access speed and efficiency decrease. Git provides the GC function to help users optimize repository space.

Users can optimize repository space by accessing Repository Homepage -> 'Repository Settings' -> 'Feature Settings' -> 'Repository GC' and using the Repository GC feature.
