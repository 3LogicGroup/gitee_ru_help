Title: How to Compare Submitted Code
---


We want to know what modifications we made to the file when submitting the code: "Repository Details"->"Code", click "x commits" to enter the commit record page, and then click "Compare" button again. The commit record checkbox will appear, check the commit record and click "Confirm" to see the code comparison.
