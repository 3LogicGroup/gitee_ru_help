After the paid enterprise package expires, if the actual usage limit of the current enterprise (including the number of members, total repository capacity, etc.) does not exceed the free version quota, it will automatically be downgraded to the enterprise free version.

If the current enterprise's actual usage limit (including the number of members, total repository capacity, etc.) exceeds the free version quota, the use of corresponding functions (such as push, pull, etc.) will be restricted until the user reduces it to meet the quota of the enterprise free version.
