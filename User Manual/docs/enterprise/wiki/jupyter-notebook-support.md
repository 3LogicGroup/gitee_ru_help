Jupyter Notebook (previously known as IPython Notebook) is an interactive notebook that supports running over 40 programming languages.

Jupyter Notebook is essentially a web application that facilitates the creation and sharing of literate programming documents, supporting real-time code, mathematical equations, visualization, and markdown. Its uses include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning, and more.

Now Jupyter Notebook is widely used in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Gitee recently added support for rendering Jupyter Notebook documents (.ipynb). The rendering effect is as shown below.
