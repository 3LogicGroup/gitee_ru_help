In Gitee Enterprise Edition, the 'Documents' feature is used to build team knowledge bases and facilitate knowledge sharing among members; folders contain documents and files, providing unified document management for enterprises.

In 'Documents', each user has an independent knowledge management space, which provides clear storage and traceability for document categories, publishing, previewing, and version history.

Integrate 'Enterprise Documents', 'Enterprise Attachments', and 'Repository Wiki' into one view, centralizing and standardizing the knowledge base information for easy reference at any time.
